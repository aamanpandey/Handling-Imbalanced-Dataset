# Handling-Imbalanced-Dataset

## Dataset: Hospital Mortality Rate

## Objective:

- Use Imbalanced data handling techniques
- Make prediction model

##  Key Points:
- Used Data Pipelines for data pre-processing
- Used ROC-AUC as scoring metrics
- Used different technique to handle imbalanced dataset
- Used Cost Sensitive Techniques
- Used Data Sampling Techniques
- Used Grid Search to tune hyperparameter of the ML models
- Used corss validation score to decide best model for the dataset

## ML Algo used:
- KNN classification
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Support Vector Machine
- Kernelized Support Vector Machine (rbf, polynomial and sigmoid kernels)
- Decision Tree classification
- Two models with Bagging (best model from HW2 and Decision Tree)
- Two models with Pasting (best model from HW2 and Decision Tree)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boost 
- Extra-Trees
- XGBoost 
- Created a correlation matrix using prediction from all the models
- Voting Classifier to combine results of top 5 models 
- Voting Classifier to combine results of 5 models with least correlation.
- Stacking Classifier to combine results of top 5 models 
- Stacking Classifier to combine results of  models with least correlation.
